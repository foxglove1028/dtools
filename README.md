<h1>dtools</h1>
<h2>What is dTools?</h2>
dTools is a set of three applications that are geared to help players and managers play DnD better and more organized.

The initial application was a poorly thrown together Flash and Flex application where things "appeared" to work. The revival of the project will focus on utilizing a MEAN stack (MEAN.JS) approach. The design of the interface will use Google's Material UI design conventions.

What will the deliverables be? It was never intended to be hosted on a grand server somewhere but instead the intention was to freely share the framework with people who could set up their own personal in house server for their own sessions. Eventually a "How to set up" guide will be provided... after the tools are built... of course.

<h2>The three programs are:</h2>

<h3><strong>FMA</strong> - File Manager Assistant</h3>
The File Manager Assistant is the backbone of dTools for it helps create the files needed by the other two applications.
For the FMA can help generate/add new items to the library for Armor, Spells and etc. for DMA and PCA to use in the future.

<h3><strong>DMA</strong> - Dungeon Master Assistant</h3>
The Dungeon Master Assistant is to help the dungeon master keep track of the game assets, players assets & scores.

<h3><strong>PCA</strong> - Player Character Assistant</h3>
The Player Character Assistant is to help the player keep track of their character's assets & scores.
