What is dTools?
dTools is a set of three applications that are geared to help players and managers play DnD better and more organized. [http://dtools.dragonrageseishi.com](http://dtools.dragonrageseishi.com)

The initial application was a poorly thrown together Flash and Flex application where things "appeared" to work. The revival of the project will focus on utilizing a Node.js, AngularJS and MongoDB approach. The design of the interface will use Google's Material UI design conventions.

What will the deliverables be? It was never intended to be hosted on a grand server somewhere but instead the intention was to freely share the framework with people who could set up their own personal in house server for their own sessions. Eventually a "How to set up" guide will be provided... after the tools are built... of course.

###The three programs are:

####**FMA** - File Manager Assistant
>The File Manager Assistant is the backbone of dTools for it helps create the files needed by the other two applications.
>For the FMA can help generate/add new items to the library for Armor, Spells and etc. for DMA and PCA to use in the future.

####**DMA** - Dungeon Master Assistant
>The Dungeon Master Assistant is to help the dungeon master keep track of the game assets, players assets & scores.

####**PCA** - Player Character Assistant
>The Player Character Assistant is to help the player keep track of their character's assets & scores.
